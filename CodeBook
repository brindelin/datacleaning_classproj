Code Book for TidyDataSet.txt

File contains 180 rows and 68 columns. The data set is derviced
The data set is a tidy data derived from a Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The original data set had 10,299 records and 563 columns. The steps performed via scripting to produce the tidyset is
detailed in the ReadMe.

subject: integer(1:30)
  -represents the 30 diferent subjects participating in the experiment

activity: character (1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING)
  -represents the 6 different activities the participants were measured against in the experiment

66 measurements: numeric
  -represents 66 specific measurements captured
  -These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

  fBodyAcc-XYZ
  fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  fBodyGyro-XYZ
  fBodyAccMag

  The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
  mean(): Mean value
  std(): Standard deviation
  mad(): Median absolute deviation 
  max(): Largest value in array
  min(): Smallest value in array
  sma(): Signal magnitude area
  energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
  iqr(): Interquartile range 
  entropy(): Signal entropy
  arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
  correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
  maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
  meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
  skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
  kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
  bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
  angle(): Angle between to vectors.
  
  Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
  gravityMean
  tBodyAccMean
  tBodyAccJerkMean
  tBodyGyroMean
  tBodyGyroJerkMean
